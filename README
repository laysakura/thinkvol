ThinkVolume

Description
	This program is for users who Lenovo ThinkPad T400s, Linux.
	If the volume buttons (mute/unmute, voldown, volup) are not enabled for some reasons
	(e.g. your window manager doesn't support them), this will help you.

	Once you run this program, the volume buttons will correctly work.

Usage
	Example in Ubuntu:
		Make a script named /usr/local/bin/thinkvol

			#!/bin/bash
			/usr/bin/python /path/to/this/directory/hook.py &
		
		Now you can run 'thinkvol' command.

		Press the volume buttons and check if you can control volumes.

		If you like, make 'thinkvol' run each time you login.
		I, as an awesome WM user, wrote some code in ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua

Caution
	Never kill this program manually.
	I know if you do that, your X Window System will down...
	(Actually, this program doesn't free resouce on stop.)
